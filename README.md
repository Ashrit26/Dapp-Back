# Dapp-Back

### Overview
I built the backend for my decentralized application (Dapp) on the Ethereum blockchain. The backend consists of smart contracts written in Solidity, which handle the business logic and data interactions of my application. Leveraging the Truffle Framework, I've developed and tested these smart contracts to ensure their correctness. With Ganache, I've set up a local blockchain environment for testing and development purposes. Metamask integration enables seamless interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to deploy contracts and execute transactions securely.

### Dependencies
To run the backend, you'll need the following dependencies:

1. Node Package Manager (NPM)
2. Truffle Framework
3. Ganache
4. Metamask


### Installation
1. Install Node Package Manager (NPM) from the official website.
2. Install Truffle Framework using NPM.
3. Install Ganache for a local in-memory blockchain.
4. Install the Metamask extension for Google Chrome.


### Usage
1. Boot Ganache to have a local blockchain running with preloaded accounts and ether.
2. Build smart contracts containing the business logic of the Dapp.
3. Test the smart contracts to ensure correctness.
4. Deploy the contracts to the local Ethereum blockchain using Truffle.
5. Connect Metamask to the local blockchain to interact with the smart contracts.
6. Implement additional features as needed.


### Repository Structure
1. contracts/: Contains Solidity smart contracts.
2. test/: Contains JavaScript tests for smart contracts.
3. migrations/: Contains migration scripts for deploying contracts.
4. truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file.
